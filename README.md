# Image Management UI
The Image Management UI is a frontend application built with React that allows users to display images fetched from a database via an API server. Users can view the images, delete them, and modify them.

## Setup
1. install npm (v.8.1.2) and nodejs (v16.13.1)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

## Improvements
- add tests
- dynamic image fetching based on current view
- styling
- fetch images automatically when database updates
